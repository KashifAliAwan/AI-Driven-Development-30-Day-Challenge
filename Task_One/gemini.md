## ✍️ Reflection Activity (40 min)

AI-Driven Development means creating software with the help of smart tools that support me like a helpful partner. AI makes coding faster and easier by giving suggestions, fixing mistakes and improving my work. In the future, I think humans and AI will work together as a strong team. Humans will focus on ideas and problem solving, while AI will handle the boring or repeated tasks like writing basic code and testing. Instead of replacing developers, AI will help us grow and learn faster. In this new era, development will start with AI making the first draft and helping us avoid errors early. Our job will be more creative and about building better and smarter solutions.
