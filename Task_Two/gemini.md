# AI Tool Landscape (My Own Explanation)

## Claude Code
Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write, understand, and improve code. It can generate code snippets, fix bugs, explain errors, and even help design new features simply through conversation. It feels like working with a smart partner who understands your coding needs.

## Gemini CLI
Gemini CLI is a command-line tool that brings AI directly into the terminal. It’s designed for developers who prefer working through commands. You can ask questions, generate scripts, automate tasks, and interact with AI right from the command line — making your workflow faster and more efficient.

## Bash (Command Line)
Bash is a command-line shell that allows you to control your computer using text-based commands. In AI-supported workflows, Bash becomes even more powerful because you can use it to run AI tools, manage files, execute scripts, and automate repetitive tasks without needing a graphical interface.

## Git & GitHub (Safety Net)
Git is a version control system that tracks every change you make in your code. GitHub is an online platform where you store and share your projects. Together, they act as a safety net, especially when working with AI-generated code. If something breaks or doesn’t work as expected, Git lets you undo changes, compare versions, and keep your project safe and organized.
